# Sudoku Teacher

A project for the *Software Design and Documentation* class at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute.

## Vision Statement

We aim to create a mobile application for iOS devices, which generates Sudoku puzzles and provides user initiated assistance of various degrees.

Sudoku requires no math or language skills, is easy to learn with simple rules, and has various difficulty levels. This establishes a potential market for anyone with an interest in a fun and addictive logic puzzle. Specifically, our application will target users whose goal is to learn Sudoku by guiding them through the puzzle solving process. One way this will be achieved is by providing hints of various degrees, depending on the userâ€™s need. These hints will assist the user by providing the next logical step in solving the puzzle. Another way this will be achieved is through an interactive tutorial available to the user, which will teach the rules in a clear and simple format, as to ease the learning process.
